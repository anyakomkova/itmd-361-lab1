    Hi there, my name is Anna, and I'm a 3rd year ITM student. I just transferred into IIT last semester after completing my associate's degree.

    Outside of work and school, I enjoy cooking, acrylic painting, photography, reading, working out, and trying out various arts & crafts.

    Hope you have a great semester :)
